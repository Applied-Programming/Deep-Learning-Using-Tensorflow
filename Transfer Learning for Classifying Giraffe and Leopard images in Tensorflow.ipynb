    "# Transfer Learning for Classifying Giraffe and Leopard images in Tensorflow\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we intend to perform image classification on the Animals on the Web dataset. The dataset contains images of 10 different classes of animals. However we would perform a binary classification task to classify Leopard and Giraffe images using Transfer Learning in Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images of these 2 classes of animals are stored in the sub-folders Leopard and Giraffe inside the folder Animals_Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy obtained via transfer learning using Google's Inception-v3 model was approx 98%.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to classify images of Leopard and Giraffe. The challenge mentioned to classify any two different animals and I chose Leopard and Giraffe as they might not be easily classified by a naive image classifier due to the similar colour and textures of their images and also I found a dataset which readily provided these images. I didn't choose Cats vs Dogs as such classification models are already available in plenty and I wanted to try something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Google's Inception-V3 pretrained model for Image Classification. Inception v3 is a trained for the [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) Large Visual Recognition Challenge using the data from 2012, and it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian or dishwasher. The following chart shows how the data flows in the Inception v3 model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network with many layers and a complicated structure. The [research paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v3.pdf) gives more details on how the Inception model is constructed and why it is designed that way."

    "Inception model is actually quite capable of extracting useful information from an image. So we can instead train the Inception model using another data-set, in our case the Leopard vs Giraffe dataset. But it takes several weeks using a very powerful and expensive computer to fully train the Inception model on a new data-set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can instead re-use the pre-trained Inception model and merely replace the layer that does the final classification. This is called Transfer Learning.\n",

    "I've already included the preprocessed dataset in the Github repository.  But if you want to use other animal images for classification, here's how I did it : \n",
    "\n",
    "Leopard and Giraffe images can be found in the [**Animals on the Web**](http://tamaraberg.com/animalDataset/index.html) Dataset. You can download the Giraffe images (size : 38 MB) from [here](http://tamaraberg.com/animalDataset/tarfiles/giraffe.tar.gz) and the Leopard images (size : 49 MB) from [here](http://tamaraberg.com/animalDataset/tarfiles/leopard.tar.gz). I used only the positive samples of these images which can be saved using the `possamples.html` file. Just extract the two tar files in a folder. Then open the `possamples.html` for giraffe and leopard in the browser, right click anywhere in the browser window and choose *Save as*. Save the webpage and automatically all the positive samples of the giraffe and leopard images would be stored in the directory you specified. Run the following 2 scripts by changing current path to this directory.\n",

    "The postive samples saved in the directory may not be optimal for classifying usingg transfer learning on the Inception model. The Inception model was trained on the ImageNet dataset which contains JPG / JPEG images sized **299 X 299**. Our positive samples contains some GIFs and other images in PNG format. Hence the need to preprocess the dataset."

    "The final test accuracy is almost 98%  for our two classes Leopard and Giraffe which is quite substantial given our training set contained approxiamtely only 400 images for each classes. This is where Transfer Learning really shines. All we did was use the trained Inception Model which already had learned basic features of lines, shapes and other features that increase in abstraction as we move towards the final layers of the model. We basically retrained the last layers where we supplied training images of Leopards and Giraffes and the model using its pre-learnt features could \"learn\" the features specific to these classes and hence resulted in an impressive classification accuracy of 98 %.
