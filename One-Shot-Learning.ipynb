    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a One-Shot Learning Handwritten Character Classifer written in Python using the SciPy library. The code trains against a few examples of handwritten characters and then tries to classify characters correctly. The error rate is around 38%. If you want to try a state-of-the-art, better-than-human, one-shot learning library that you can apply to all sorts of data, check out [this](https://github.com/MaxwellRebo/PyBPL) repo. \n",

    "## One-Shot Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "One-shot learning refers to the process of learning features from datasets containing few training samples. This is in contrast to some machine learning techniques like CNN which require large datasets in order to perform the learning task effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have the ability to learn categories using very few examples and can match features and perform pattern recognition well despite of less data available. If I was to provide you a reference card of an unfamiliar alphabet and show you a series of hand written variants of that alphabet, chances are you'd be able to match a high percentage of this test set with the reference alphabet -- perhaps misclassifying a few exotic variations. The key motivation for the one-shot learning technique is that systems, like humans, can use prior knowledge about object categories to classify new objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a recent paper [http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Science-2015-Lake-1332-8.pdf] that came out called Human level concept learning through probabilsitic program induction.They used something called Bayesian Program Learning or BPL to implement One Shot Learning. Bayesian referans to Baye’s thereom, which attemtps to use simple stochastic programst to reprsent concepts. The word stocasthic, referring to the theory of probability, is what Bayes theorem loosely revolves around. So by using \"simple stochastic programs\" or probability algorithms, BPL can \"represent concepts” so given the knowledge of how to write a known letter, it can calculate the chance of a novel letter being the same or not. BPL builds these \"simple stochastic programs compositionally from parts, subparts, and spatial relations. All these things exist in a hierarchy of knowledge which the machine has gained through little experience. So they trained it on a dataset of handwriting chracters and it was able to recognize chracters with a better error rate than deep learning or even humans. OK so does that mean BPL is the way to go? Well, it does have its flaws. It lacks explicit knoweldge of certain things like parallel lines, symmetry, and connections between ends of strokes and other strokes. And the learning isn’t really transferable to other things so it’s not better than deep learning in every way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few months later though, DeepMind challenged the paper by releasing their own paper called [Oneshot learning with memory augmented neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065v1.pdf). The basic idea they had was that deep learning is very data intensive, but perhaps there's a way to build a deep neural net that only needs a few examples to learn - deep Learning without the huge datasets. So they built whats called a Memory Augmented Neural Network or MANN. A MANN has two parts, a controller which is either a feed forward neural net or LSTM neural net and an external memory module. The controller interacts with the external memory module with a number of read/write heads. Its capable of long term storage via slow updates of weights and short term storage via the external memory module. They fed it a few examples of handwritten characters and continously trained it thousands of times on just those examples. It performed meta learning, which means it learned to learn. And guess what? It outperformed humans as ! So they proved that one-shot learning can be accomplished by using a neural network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will build a one-shot handwritten character classifier in Python using the Scipy library. We gotta import our dependencies first. We would require 3 libraries, numpy, scipy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python - (https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    "* scipy - `pip install scipy`\n",
    "* numpy `pip install numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 - Run the code! It'll train against the handwritten character samples in the `all_runs` folder and then test it's classification ability.\n",
    "It should output an average error rate of around 38%.\n",

    "Once we have those we can define two variables, the number of runs we want to complete and a reference var for where we store our class labels. Then in our main method we can create an array of the size of runs which is 20. We’ll use this array to store all of our classification error rates, one every run. Then we’ll write a for loop to train our algorithm 20 times. For each run, we’ll run a classification function which will attempt to classify a small sample set of images, and store the error rate in in the array. Then we’ll print out the error rate to terminal and when we are done with all of our runs, we’ll go ahead and get the mean error rate from the array and print it out as the last statement in terminal.

    "So how does this classification step work? Well, before we answer that , we need to understand these two methods, `load_img_as_points` and `modified_hausdorf_distance`. The load_img_as_points function loads an image file, in our case this will be a character image. It then converts the image to an array and finds all the non zero values, that is all of the inked pixels and stores that in an array. then it creates an array of all the coordinates of those pixels and returns that. The modified_hausdorf_distance is a metric that computes the similarity between two images by comparing their pixel coordinate arrays. That comes from the load_img_as_points functions. It calculates the mean difference between both images and returns it. The last parameter of the classificaton function, cost, just notifies the function that small values from the modified_hausdorf_distance mean more similar."
