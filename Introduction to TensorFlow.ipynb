    "## About TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "[TensorFlow™](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would be learning about using TensorFlow to build interesting applications right from Image classifiers to Speech recognizers. But first, the basics. This webpage consists of demo scripts which would help us to understand how to use TensorFlow for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset(which is quite known as the \"Hello World\" program for Deep Learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "# TensorFlow<sup>TM</sup> MNIST train and predict :\n",
    "## Recognise Handwritten Digits by saving and restoring TensorFlow model\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This project uses the MNIST tutorials from the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started). The two tutorials, the beginner tutorial and the expert tutorial, use different deep learning models. The python scripts ending with _1 use the model from the beginner tutorial. The scripts ending with _2 use the model from the advanced tutorial. As expected scripts using the model from the expert tutorial give better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This projects consists of four scripts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. _create_model_1.py_ – creates a model model.ckpt file based on the beginners tutorial.\n",
    "2. *create_model_1.py* – creates a model model2.ckpt file based on the expert tutorial.\n",
    "3. *predict_1.py* – uses the model.ckpt (beginners tutorial) file to predict the correct integer form a handwritten number in a .png file.\n",
    "4. *predict_2.py* – uses the model2.ckpt (expert tutorial) file to predict the correct integer form a handwritten number in a .png file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "The following Python libraries are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- sys - should be installed by default\n",
    "- tensorflow - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)\n",
    "- PIL – [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing TensorFlow\n",
    "Of course TensorFlow needs to be installed. The [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/index.html) has a good manual .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python Image Library (PIL)\n",
    "The Python Image Library (PIL) is no longer available. Luckily there is a good fork called Pillow. Installing is as easy as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sudo pip install Pillow```"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Or look at the [Pillow documentation](http://pillow.readthedocs.org) for other installation options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The python scripts\n",
    "The easiest way the use the scripts is to put all four scripts in the same folder. If TensorFlow is installed correctly the images to train the model are downloaded automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Running\n",
    "Running is based on the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create the model file\n",
    "2. create an image file containing a handwritten number\n",
    "3. predict the integer \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "### 1. create the model file\n",
    "The easiest way is to cd to the directory where the python files are located. Then run:\n",
